                            In building a network that has become synonymous with innovation and strategic investments, we are very clear about the result that we would all like to see; provision of services that will truly make a difference in people’s lives. This remains a key pillar of our Transforming Lives vision.

                          <p>
                            Our focus remains on driving and entrenching connectivity across the country, because we have seen the impact or services have on the people. One only gets a clearer idea of the impact we have had during a visit to some of the marginalized areas. Our newly installed base stations have led to improved security in areas such as in Kapedo; the health of a community has improved substantially because they now can store the medicine that needs refrigeration within the base station, powered by our generators in Garissa, hungry refugees have been fed courtesy of an app that we developed with our partners under the Chakula Chap Chap program; yet others have said they are better off financially because access to a mobile phone allows them to know the prevailing market prices of commodities.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            These are the ‘small’ things that cumulatively transform the lives of our customers. And we are proud of our people and the partners who have made this happen.

                            In spite of the fragile economic environment prevailing during the year under review, with some macro-economic uncertainties impacting on the operating environment, the business remained vibrant and impactful on the communities that we operate in.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            I am, however, happy to report that despite these hiccups, the business remained robust and committed to providing the essential services that are our raison d’etre, our reason for being.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            We operate in a highly competitive and regulated environment, which necessitates that we adhere to the highest standards of corporate governance. At the board level, we have been at the forefront of entrenching corporate governance throughout the company.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            We are witnessing seismic shifts in the competitive landscape, with new forms of competition continuing to emerge even from non-telco players. For instance, the integration of Fintech in banks, especially money transfer, is a signal that the landscape is continuously shifting and we cannot afford to take our eyes off the ball.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The competition means that we must continue differentiating our products, and delivering solutions to our customers that gives us an edge. We are confident that we will continue offering our customers a superior experience.

                            The company continued to deliver strong financial results, with growth posted in all the main business segments. This was made possible by targeted investments in network expansion and system integrity, a customer-focused business model, increased uptake of our products as well as innovation, which has kept us attuned to the needs of our customers.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            In the 2017 F/Y, our business grew at 14.8%, which was stronger than the 13.8% posted in Financial Year 2016. Thanks to the strong trading performance, underlying net income improved by 18.3% year-on-year.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            To maintain an edge in our business, we invested Ksh38 billion on improving coverage, capacity and quality of our network. We also paid Ksh2.5 billion in the year to acquire 10Mhz of LTE spectrum and rolled out more than 55 new sites during the year.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            During the year, we also introduced M-PESA ‘Kadogo’, which essentially means that transactions under 100 shillings do not attract a service fee. We call this democratising M-PESA, which further strengthens our credentials as pioneers in entrenching financial inclusion in Kenya.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            M-PESA is the company’s bread and butter, and continues to power the economy with a 29.7% increase in the total value transacted from Ksh5,294 trillion in F/Y2016 to Ksh6,869 trillion in F/Y2017. We see increasing growth in M-PESA since a significant portion of transactions in Kenya is in cash. As the economy becomes more digital, this provides us with immense opportunities to grow business.
