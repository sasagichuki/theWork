				<p>The company continued to deliver strong financial results, with growth posted in all the main business segments. This was made possible by targeted investments in network expansion and system integrity, a customer-focused business model, increased uptake of our products as well as innovation, which has kept us attuned to the needs of our customers.
<br><br>
				In the 2017 F/Y, our business grew at 14.8%, which was stronger than the 13.8% posted in Financial Year 2016. Thanks to the strong trading performance, underlying net income improved by 18.3% year-on-year.
<br><br>
				To maintain an edge in our business, we invested Ksh38 billion on improving coverage, capacity and quality of our network. We also paid Ksh2.5 billion in the year to acquire 10Mhz of LTE spectrum and rolled out more than 55 new sites during the year.
<br><br>
				During the year, we also introduced M-PESA ‘Kadogo’, which essentially means that transactions under 100 shillings do not attract a service fee. We call this democratising M-PESA, which further strengthens our credentials as pioneers in entrenching financial inclusion in Kenya.
<br><br>
				M-PESA is the company’s bread and butter, and continues to power the economy with a 29.7% increase in the total value transacted from Ksh5,294 trillion in F/Y2016 to Ksh6,869 trillion in F/Y2017. We see increasing growth in M-PESA since a significant portion of transactions in Kenya is in cash. As the economy becomes more digital, this provides us with immense opportunities to grow business.</p>		<!-- </div> -->
