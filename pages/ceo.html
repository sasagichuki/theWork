				<p>Safaricom exists to fulfill a purpose. That purpose is to Transform Lives, and over the last one year, we have continued to emphasise and implement transformative strategies that touch the lives of our shareholders, customers, staff members and other stakeholders. We believe this purpose driven strategy is what prompted over three million new customers to join our network during the year.
<br><br>
				In building a network that has become synonymous with innovation and strategic investments, we are very clear about the result that we would all like to see; provision of services that will truly make a difference in people’s lives. This remains a key pillar of our Transforming Lives vision.
<br><br>
				Our focus remains on driving and entrenching connectivity across the country, because we have seen the impact or services have on the people. One only gets a clearer idea of the impact we have had during a visit to some of the marginalized areas. Our newly installed base stations have led to improved security in areas such as in Kapedo; the health of a community has improved substantially because they now can store the medicine that needs refrigeration within the base station, powered by our generators in Garissa, hungry refugees have been fed courtesy of an app that we developed with our partners under the Chakula Chap Chap program; yet others have said they are better off financially because access to a mobile phone allows them to know the prevailing market prices of commodities.
<br><br>
				These are the ‘small’ things that cumulatively transform the lives of our customers. And we are proud of our people and the partners who have made this happen.</p>		<!-- </div> -->
