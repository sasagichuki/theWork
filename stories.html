                      Peter Mbugua, a taxi driver in Naivasha, has never been as early adopter of technology; he likes to wait and see what happens. As for M-PESA, he has been more than happy with the way his life has changed becaue of using this product.was happy with M-Pesa because of how it had changed his life.But that was before he was introduced to M-Pesa 1Tap, an improvement on his much loved M-Pesa, which is aimed at accelerating and easing payments. “It has been three weeks since I started using the technology and the results have been amazing. No complications.

With more and more business outlets embracing this technology, Mbugua is happy to use this service to make most of his payments. “It is a secure platform and your pin number can never be compromised since the request is made in yourpersonal phone,” Mbugua said adding, “I have been recommending it to my friends and the response is positive”.

                      The new feather on the M-Pesa cap comes 10 years after the introduction of the mobile money service which, according to a recent study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has lifted more than 800,000 Kenyans out of poverty.

                      Just like Mbugua, Simeon Kemboi, a resident of Nakuru, says M-Pesa 1Tap is a must have. “I am not a person who embraces every new product that comes into the market. I take time and buy into it if I have to or ignore it all together,” he said. But curiosity got the better of him when the service was introduced to him by Safaricom promoters. “They explained all the details pertaining to its use. It is simple to use and so everyone, regardless of age, can understand,” said Kemboi.

                      He too has been using the technology for all his purchases. “In fact I have become a brand ambassador
                      of 1Tap,” he quips. When the promoters visited Kemboi’s office he was the one encouraging his colleagues to try the new product “Payment has been simplified because you will only need to have a card to make payments even to business people at the grassroots level who we are now using Lipa na Mpesa,” he said. Juliet Kanyi, a shop owner, says M-Pesa 1Tap has made payments simpler which saves her and her customers time.
                      “My customers don’t have to queue to make payments. 1Tap has made it much easier,” she said.

                      M-PESA has grown from a mobile money transfer service to serve the various needs of Kenyans – from services like savings, loans, payments for goods and services, international transfers and much, much more. 1Tap will supplement a number of initiatives that Safaricom has undertaken to expand the M-PESA ecosystem in the last year. In March, the telco introduced a 50 per cent tariff reduction for all Lipa Na M-PESA Buy Goods merchant fees.

                            Safaricom exists to fulfill a purpose. That purpose is to Transform Lives, and over the last one year, we have continued to emphasise and implement transformative strategies that touch the lives of our shareholders, customers, staff members and other stakeholders. We believe this purpose driven strategy is what prompted over three million new customers to join our network during the year.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            In building a network that has become synonymous with innovation and strategic investments, we are very clear about the result that we would all like to see; provision of services that will truly make a difference in people’s lives. This remains a key pillar of our Transforming Lives vision.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Our focus remains on driving and entrenching connectivity across the country, because we have seen the impact or services have on the people. One only gets a clearer idea of the impact we have had during a visit to some of the marginalized areas. Our newly installed base stations have led to improved security in areas such as in Kapedo; the health of a community has improved substantially because they now can store the medicine that needs refrigeration within the base station, powered by our generators in Garissa, hungry refugees have been fed courtesy of an app that we developed with our partners under the Chakula Chap Chap program; yet others have said they are better off financially because access to a mobile phone allows them to know the prevailing market prices of commodities.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            These are the ‘small’ things that cumulatively transform the lives of our customers. And we are proud of our people and the partners who have made this happen.

                            In spite of the fragile economic environment prevailing during the year under review, with some macro-economic uncertainties impacting on the operating environment, the business remained vibrant and impactful on the communities that we operate in.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            I am, however, happy to report that despite these hiccups, the business remained robust and committed to providing the essential services that are our raison d’etre, our reason for being.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            We operate in a highly competitive and regulated environment, which necessitates that we adhere to the highest standards of corporate governance. At the board level, we have been at the forefront of entrenching corporate governance throughout the company.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            We are witnessing seismic shifts in the competitive landscape, with new forms of competition continuing to emerge even from non-telco players. For instance, the integration of Fintech in banks, especially money transfer, is a signal that the landscape is continuously shifting and we cannot afford to take our eyes off the ball.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The competition means that we must continue differentiating our products, and delivering solutions to our customers that gives us an edge. We are confident that we will continue offering our customers a superior experience.

                            The company continued to deliver strong financial results, with growth posted in all the main business segments. This was made possible by targeted investments in network expansion and system integrity, a customer-focused business model, increased uptake of our products as well as innovation, which has kept us attuned to the needs of our customers.
                          </p>

                            In the 2017 F/Y, our business grew at 14.8%, which was stronger than the 13.8% posted in Financial Year 2016. Thanks to the strong trading performance, underlying net income improved by 18.3% year-on-year.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            To maintain an edge in our business, we invested Ksh38 billion on improving coverage, capacity and quality of our network. We also paid Ksh2.5 billion in the year to acquire 10Mhz of LTE spectrum and rolled out more than 55 new sites during the year.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            During the year, we also introduced M-PESA ‘Kadogo’, which essentially means that transactions under 100 shillings do not attract a service fee. We call this democratising M-PESA, which further strengthens our credentials as pioneers in entrenching financial inclusion in Kenya.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            M-PESA is the company’s bread and butter, and continues to power the economy with a 29.7% increase in the total value transacted from Ksh5,294 trillion in F/Y2016 to Ksh6,869 trillion in F/Y2017. We see increasing growth in M-PESA since a significant portion of transactions in Kenya is in cash. As the economy becomes more digital, this provides us with immense opportunities to grow business.
